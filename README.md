This project uses a Raspberry Pi model 3 Ver. B and a YF-S201 Water flow sensor to measure and record water flow data for agricultural applications.

The project uses the following libraries:
django - for web interface
wiringpi - to capture data from the flow sensor via GPIO
Adafruid_SSD1306 - to control an OLED display via I2C.

Wiring diagram, BOM, and setup instructions will be included in this readme when the project becomes finalized
